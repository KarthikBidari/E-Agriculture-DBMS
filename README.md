# E-Agriculture-DBMS

The main aim of this project is to develop a farmer friendly database which will help them in increasing their productivity. It is all about information exchange between farmers and government organizations, universities, research organizations, NGOs, farmers' organizations, private sector, and the wider community.

The DBMS connections will not work until the farmers.sql file is set up in a server. Clicking on home.html will open the home page.
